# Visual-Analytics-of-Transport-Storage-Labour-Trends
This R project explores Yorkshire’s transport &amp; storage employment (2015-2024). Using data viz like parallel coordinates, it tracks regional shifts &amp; structural patterns. Designed for clarity, it offers insights into labour evolution.

# 📊 Yorkshire Labour Market Analysis (2015-2024)
### Transport & Storage Sector Data Visualization Project

This repository contains a deep-dive analysis of Yorkshire’s industrial evolution. Using R, I have transformed raw employment data into a suite of interconnected visualisations that reveal how the region’s workforce has shifted over the last decade.


##  Project Objectives
* **Track Patterns:** Analyzing long-term employment trends from 2015 to 2024.
* **Regional Benchmarking:** Comparing different districts using multi-variable analysis.
* **Visual Storytelling:** Using advanced R plots to make complex data accessible and insightful.

##  The Visual Gallery
I have developed four distinct types of visualizations to capture every angle of the data:

* **Parallel Coordinates Plot:** A multi-dimensional view to spot regional outliers and structural differences.
* **Stacked Area Chart:** Tracking the "volume" of work—shows how different sub-sectors grew or shrank together.
* **Alluvial Diagram:** Mapping the "flow"—perfect for seeing how labour moved between categories over time.
* **Radial Heatmap:** A circular intensity map that highlights employment density "hotspots" across the region.

##  Tech Stack
* **Language:** R
* **Core Libraries:** `tidyverse`, `janitor`, `GGally`, `viridis`
* **Workflow:** Data Cleaning ➡️ Transformation ➡️ Mapping ➡️ Accessible Visualization

## 📂 Inside the Repo
* 📁 **visualisation/**: All high-res plots (Note: Files are saved as `.png.png`).
* 📄 **script.R**: The complete, commented code for reproducibility.
* 📄 **README.md**: Project summary and guide.

**Data Ethics & Accessibility:** All plots use the `viridis` palette to ensure they are readable for everyone, including those with colour-blindness.



##  Tools & Libraries
This analysis was performed using **R Statistical Software** with the following libraries:

- **tidyverse** – Data manipulation & visualization  
- **janitor** – Data cleaning  
- **GGally** – Parallel Coordinates Plot  
- **viridis** – Accessible color palettes  


## 📁 Repository Structure
* **/visualisation**: Contains all generated plots (named as `.png.png`).
* **script.R**: The complete R code for data cleaning and plotting.
* **README.md**: Project documentation and home page preview.

> **Note:** The files are saved with a `.png.png` extension, which is intentional for this project version.
