# Visual-Analytics-of-Transport-Storage-Labour-Trends
This R project explores Yorkshire’s transport &amp; storage employment (2015-2024). Using data viz like parallel coordinates, it tracks regional shifts &amp; structural patterns. Designed for clarity, it offers insights into labour evolution.

# Yorkshire Transport & Storage Employment Analysis (2015-2024)
This project explores employment trends in Yorkshire’s transport and storage sector using a set of interconnected data visualisations created in R. By combining multiple chart types, the analysis highlights regional differences, structural changes, and long-term patterns between 2015 and 2024. 

The visualisations are designed to support clear interpretation, accessibility, and meaningful insight into how labour distribution has evolved across the region.
### 1. Parallel Coordinates Plot
Used to compare multiple variables across different regions of Yorkshire to identify structural differences.
