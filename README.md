# Visual-Analytics-of-Transport-Storage-Labour-Trends
This R project explores Yorkshire’s transport &amp; storage employment (2015-2024). Using data viz like parallel coordinates, it tracks regional shifts &amp; structural patterns. Designed for clarity, it offers insights into labour evolution.

# Yorkshire Transport & Storage Employment Analysis (2015-2024)
This project explores employment trends in Yorkshire’s transport and storage sector using a set of interconnected data visualisations created in R. By combining multiple chart types, the analysis highlights regional differences, structural changes, and long-term patterns between 2015 and 2024. 

# Yorkshire Transport & Storage Employment Analysis (2015-2024)

This project explores employment trends in Yorkshire’s **transport and storage sector** using a set of interconnected data visualisations created in **R**. By combining multiple chart types, the analysis highlights **regional differences**, **structural changes**, and **long-term patterns** between 2015 and 2024.

The visualisations are designed to support **clear interpretation**, **accessibility**, and **insightful analysis** of how labour distribution has evolved across the region.

### 1. Parallel Coordinates Plot
Compares multiple variables across different regions of Yorkshire to identify structural differences.

### 2. Stacked Area Chart
Shows cumulative growth and the proportion of different sub-sectors over the 2015-2024 period.

##  Tools & Libraries
This analysis was performed using **R Statistical Software** with the following libraries:
* **tidyverse** - Data manipulation & visualization
* **janitor** - Data cleaning
* **GGally** - Parallel Coordinates Plot
* **viridis** - Accessible color palettes

## 📁 Repository Structure
* **/visualisation**: Contains all generated plots (named as `.png.png`).
* **script.R**: The complete R code for data cleaning and plotting.
* **README.md**: Project documentation and home page preview.

> **Note:** The files are saved with a `.png.png` extension, which is intentional for this project version.
